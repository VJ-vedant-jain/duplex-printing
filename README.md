# duplex-printing (pdf)

I just made this cuz my printer doesn't do duplex printing

Run main.py in /src inputting path of your pdf
The pdf will be split into two different files namely first_run.pdf and second_run.pdf saved in src/temp

First print the first_run.pdf then well either ransack ur brain or check a guide online on how you should change orientation of your print
Then print the second_run.pdf on the paper. Pretty simple once u get the hang of it

Future plans to add support for .docx files
andddd maybe a gui (proooobablyy) :)
